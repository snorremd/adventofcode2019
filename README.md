# Advent of Code 2019

The yearly advent of code is upon us.
In this repository I will post Clojure solutions to some of the tasks.
First and foremost this is an opportunity for myself to practice my Clojure skills.
Like last year I might not complete that many tasks, but I will certainly give it a try.
If you see some solutions that could be dramatically improved with regards to performance or simplicity, please let me know.

## Running code

Fire up your Clojure editor of choice with Clojure support, launch a REPL, and evaluate code.
Each day is given a separate namespace.
You should put the input data into the `input` folder, generally as `day<n>.txt`.
